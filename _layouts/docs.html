		<article class="content contains-screenshots editable"><h2>Introduction</h2><p>The Jaguar E-Type or the Jaguar XK-E for the North American market is a British sports car, which was manufactured by Jaguar Cars Ltd between 1961 and 1975. Its combination of beauty, high performance, and <a href="google.com"><strong>competitive pricing established</strong></a> the marque as an icon of 1960s motoring. At a time when most cars had drum brakes, live rear axles, and mediocre performance, the E-Type sprang on the scene with 150 mph and a sub-7 second 0-60 time, monocoque construction, disc brakes, rack and pinion steering, independent front and rear suspension, and unrivaled looks.[3] In fact, the E-Type was based on Jaguar's own famed racer, the Type D, which had won the world's most prestigious sports-car race three consecutive years (1955-1957)[4] and, as such, it was the first production vehicle not to use a separate body bolted onto a chassis, instead employing the racing design of a body tub attached to a tubular framework, with the engine bolted directly to the framework.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><img alt="" src="/uploads/jaguar-e-type_1961_1.jpg" width="800" height="377" /></p><h3 id="what-is-jekyll">What is Jekyll?</h3><p>Jekyll is a static site generator. It takes source files and generates an entirely static website. This is different from how a typical CMS such as Wordpress works. With Wordpress when a visitor goes to a page, that page is generated on the fly. With Jekyll, the entire website is generated upfront so visitors are simply served static files.</p><p><img alt="Jekyll Logo" src="/img/logo-2x.png" /></p><h3 id="why-use-jekyll">Why use Jekyll?</h3><p>There&rsquo;s been huge trend towards static technologies mostly due to the complexity of current systems. Jekyll is:</p><ul><li><strong>Simple</strong> - There&rsquo;s far less moving parts required for a Jekyll website. This makes Jekyll websites extremely fast and simple to build.</li><li><strong>Fast</strong> - Jekyll websites are among the fastest on the internet. There&rsquo;s no time spent generating a page, the web server simply needs to return a file.</li><li><strong>Secure</strong> - Jekyll websites are secure because it&rsquo;s just a static website. You don&rsquo;t need to worry about installing security patches or worrying if a plugin has vulnerabilities.</li><li><strong>Scalable</strong> - There&rsquo;s no backend processing on Jekyll websites which makes them insanely scalable.</li><li><strong>Source Controlled</strong> - The entire website including all the content can be source controlled. This gives you the entire history of the website and the ability to roll back to any version.</li><li><strong>Powerful</strong> - Blogging, photo galleries, layouts and other features you would normally need a backend for are all possible with Jekyll.</li></ul><div id="disqus_thread">&nbsp;</div><script type="text/javascript">
